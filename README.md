## Overview
To get the most out of React we need to couple it with an open source, JavaScript runtime called **NodeJS**. The primary thing we'll be using node for is to run our development server while we're writing React code. Using Node will also take care of converting our React code to vanilla JavaScript so it can run in the browser, and will allow us to use the Node Package Manager
to install packages and extensions for our React apps.

In the React project example we looked at previously, we used the command `npm start` to start the React app. Npm stands for Node Package Manager, and it's a tool that is distributed with NodeJS which allows us to install and uninstall packages, run a development server and even create and destroy React applications. While it's not an absolute requirement to use Node, React and Node are often tightly coupled, so we'll be using Node and npm throughout this series.

## **How to create your first React App**
* Create a repository on GitHub
* Create a GitPod workspace from it
* Use the npx command inside your workspace to create your react application
